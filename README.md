# Solutioning Highlights

## Hightlights of your improvements (tests and others you choose)
- Create app.js file and moved the core functionality for better isolation and testability.

## What would you improve next if you had more time?
- had plenty of time since the backend code is simple enough to do a full code coverage and simple test.

## Questions you would ask and your own answers and assumptions
- not as of the moment since the backend functionality is simple and straightforward. 

## Explanations of decisions or the approach you took
- as the request was for full code coverage and testing, that we the focus of this exercise. and since in the backend must be responsive no need for additional code which can introduce overhead.

## Any other notes you feel relevant to evaluate your test improvements
- the original code did not have testing functionality installed so i added that together with another testing package called supertest which simplifies api testing for nodejs backend.
